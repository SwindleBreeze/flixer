## Instructions for Use on Local Machine

1. Unfortunately, you need to open two different browsers (e.g., Chrome and Edge, Edge and Firefox, etc.). It's essential that the same browser is not used twice, as the application relies on sessions and cookies.

2. The landing page is `index.php`. You can press the "X" button to view movies and get information about them. However, for all other functionalities, you must log in.

3. Log in using one of the usernames and passwords below and check the key:
    - Example: Log in as `pivk123` and use the key `7a6i45233a` under "Use your friend's key". In another browser, log in as `maradona` using the same key `7a6i45233a`.

    Note: While `maradona` may not have any liked movies under this check key, they will be connected with `pivk123`, and if they like the same movies, the matches will be displayed.

    Alternatively, you can generate your own key as `maradona` and use it as `pivk123`'s "Use your friend's key".

4. Like movies in both browsers, and you'll receive a notification if you've matched on movies.

## Instructions for Use of Web App

To use the web app, follow these steps:

1. Connect to [flixr.koderverse.com](flixr.koderverse.com).

2. Disliking movies is available without logging in. However, to like and view movies, users need to log in or register new accounts.

3. When logged in, users can use the friend's code or generate their own code (and share it with friends) to like movies.

4. Matches can be checked under the "Matched" page when they occur.

## User Credentials and Matches (Passwords were created before password constraints):

| Username  | Password       | Check Key      | Matches                        |
